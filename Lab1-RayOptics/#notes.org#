* Exp1Pt1
** Q1
*** Rays are straight, but not parallel
** Q2
*** thicker and duller (not as sharp; is fuzzy) further from Slit Plate
** Q3
*** all rays appear to originate directly from bulb (even at angle)
** Q4
*** as angle increases, width increases and distinctness decreases
** Q5
*** Most distinct when the Slit Plate is vertical, and least distinct when horizontal.

** Q2
*** The reflected and incident rays are visible on the 2D surface.
** Q3
*** angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection
* Exp3
** Q1
*** yes
** Q2
*** d_1 = 30.15cm
** Q3
*** d_2 = 30.05cm
* Exp4
** Q1
*** no
** Q2
*** yes; slightly bent
** Q3
*** The two measurements are mostly the same. Differences are attributed to our inability to perfectly align the ray with the Ray Table.

** Q3
*** red has minimum, some yellow, some green, blue, some purple has maximum
** Q4
*** at 40deg incidence:
**** red: 76.5
**** blue: 85
* Exp6pt2
** Q1
*** While reflection off the flat edge is dim, the reflection from the curved edge is much more prominent and complete at 80 degrees.
** Q2
*** yes; there is always a reflected ray
** Q3
*** yes; the incidence angles match the reflected angles
** Q4
*** no refracted ray for >45 angles of incidence on curved edge
** Q5
*** as angle of incidence increased, the refracted ray decreases in intensity while the refracted ray increases
** Q6
*** 83; when refraction disappears
* Exp7
** Q1
*** magnified
** Q2
*** yes
** Q3
*** d_i decreases when d_o increases
** Q4
*** d_i would tend toward f because (1/(d_o)), as d_o -> inf, = 0
** Q5
*** view screen = 103
*** lens = 95
*** obj = 20
*** source = 10
*** focal length = 103- 95 = 8cm
**** theoretical = 7.5cm
*** at 50mm, no focused image, because d_o < f
*** at 75mm (focal length of lens (f)), d_i = inf, because d_o = f
*** at 100, high error because difficult to find point of highest focus, and height exceeded viewing screen
** Q6
*** [calc]
** Q7
*** [above (Q5)] (d_o > f) for image to form
* Exp8pt1
** Q1
*** yes; colors appear from white light
** Q2
*** white; the colors are combined
* Exp8pt2
** Q1
*** transmitted: green; reflected: white
** Q2
*** reflected: white
*** cannot tell because only white light is reflected
** Q3
*** NOTE: no blue filter; had to use blue/green filter
*** reflected: blue
** Q4
*** it reflects only green light and absorbs all other colors
* Exp9
* Exp10pt1
** Q1
*** no; because a significant portion of the light is not making it through the polarizers
** Q2
*** no; the light is visible no matter the orientation of a single polarizer

** Q1
*** where the reflected rays cross
** Q2
*** the image not noticeably affected unless it is very close
*** because light rays become divergent
** Q3
*** no; because the rays are divergent
** Q4
*** no; because the rays diverge
* Exp11pt3
** Q1
*** increases as d_o decreases because M=-\frac{d_i}{d_o}
** Q2
*** yes; yes, if image is viewed from past the focal point, the rays have converged and crossed over
* Exp11pt4
** Q1
*** yes, but the more extreme (closer to the edges) ones are blurrier
** Q2
*** make it a parabola
* Exp12pt1
** Q1
*** 6.6cm
** Q2
*** ray tracing
** Q3
*** at 150mm, clearly inverted
*** at ~100, the image is formed behind the target, so it could not be captured on the viewing screen
