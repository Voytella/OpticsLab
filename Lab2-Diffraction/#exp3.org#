* tripe-double
** triple: diffraction pattern both parallel and perpendicular to wave packets
* dots
** darker, more well defined, diffraction pattern than holes
* Q1
** similarity
*** wave envelope same when slit width is same
** difference
*** single slit does not have small divisions within the envelope
* Q2
** envelope stays same, but separation of inner minima decreases
* Q3
** when slit width increases, wave envelope bunches together, but inner minima separation stays same
* Q4
** envelope and inner slit separation is same
** triple slit each maximum has another diffraction pattern perpendicular to envelop
* Q5
** the line allows far more light to pass through, and there is a horizontal component to the pattern
** the slit has just a vertical component
** the two share envelop patterns
* Q6
** dot pattern darker, but more well defined (concentric rings)
** both concentric rings
