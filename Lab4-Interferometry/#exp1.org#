* Procedure
** Pt. 1
*** 3
**** 52.5 um
*** 5
**** 53.2 um NOTE: including initial rotation
*** 6
**** d_m = 0.7 um
*** 7
**** N = 20
** Pt. 2
*** 1
**** polarizing makes the image slightly dimmer; angle has no affect
*** 2
**** polarizing makes image slightly less dim than previous polarization (both mirrors)
*** 3
**** the image gets very slightly brighter and dimmer as one of the polarizers is rotated
**** pattern exists when angle of polariztion is same, disappears when angles are perpendicular
* Analysis
** Pt.1
*** wavelength calc
** Pt.2
*** 1
**** laser is not polarized; rotation of polarizer did not affect image
*** 2
**** no more information provided; similar results as step 1
*** 3
**** they don't interfere; the different polarization angle won't allow it
* Questions
** 1
*** 
** 2
*** more accurate
** 3
*** 
** 4
*** 
** 5
*** placement of final reading (between markings on Vernier scale)
*** backlash compensation
** 6
*** 
** 7
*** polarized light does not interfere with light polarized at a perpendicular angl
